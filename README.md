# KVKK Personal Data Masking Tool

A Python + Streamlit tool that detects personal data in free text or CSV/Excel files and protects it
(masking, pseudonymization or removal) before the data is sent to a test environment or an AI tool.
Built as a course project for an IT Law class, focusing on the Turkish Personal Data Protection Law (KVKK, Law No. 6698).

> All sample data in this repository is synthetic. Numbers are generated to pass validation algorithms
> but are not linked to any real person.
